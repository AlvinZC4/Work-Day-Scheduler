This application is a daily event calendar that breaks each day down by the hour for every hour of the typical work day (8am - 5pm) and allows the user to create and save events for each hour,

The calendar displays the current date and time as well as a row for each hour of the work day.  As the day progresses any hours that have already passed are displayed in grey. The current hour is displayed in red, and any hours of the day that are still ahead are displayed in green.

The user may click on any of the rows that repersent each hour and write an event on the calendar.  The user may then save the event so that if the applicaiton is closed and reopened the event will still be shown.  The Clear Calendar button will clear all saved events from the calendar.
